In Mario, GoodBugAgent.java was the best version that Jonah and I could come up with, and gets most of the way through level 1. However, it has issues with level 0, so I have also included OldAgent.java, which is simpler and more reliable on level 0.

SlidingPuzzle contains four bots more or less identical but using breadth-first search, depth-first search, iterative deepending depth-first search, a* search.

GA.java is the genetic algorithm "art forging" assignment.

PruneStableBot.java is the Othello playing bot, a collaboration between Zack, Jonah, and myself.

linear_regression.py is the stock market predictions assignment.

In Neural Netwrok, mushrooms.py is my ANN that categorizes mushrooms as edible or poisonous given their properties. Mushrooms.csv is the cleaned-up dataset of mushrooms.

movies.py is the unsupervised learning assignment.

Thank you!
